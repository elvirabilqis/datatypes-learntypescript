/**
 * A teacher wants to verify student attendance before starting class. There are 30 students in the classroom. Instead of writing the attendance message 30 times, the teacher wants the system to display an attendance check for every student.
 * The expected output is:
 * -------------------------------------
 * Checking attendance for Student #1
 * Checking attendance for Student #2
 * ...
 * Checking attendance for Student #30
 * Attendance verification completed.
 * -------------------------------------
 * 
 * Tasks: 
 * 1. Create a program using a for loop.
 * 2. Display the attendance message for every student.
 * 3. After the loop finishes, display: "Attendance verification completed"
